### Setting up MongoDB

Note: You need MongoDB set up and running to run the code locally. [Installation instructions](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/)

Once you've installed MongoDB start up the MongoDB server in a new terminal with the following commands:

```
mkdir db
mongod --dbpath=./db --smallfiles
```

Then open a new terminal and type in `mongo` and type in `use chat_dev`
This is your database interface.  You can query the database for records for example: `db.users.find()` or `db.stats()`.

Now that you've done all that, you can go go ahead and code away!
